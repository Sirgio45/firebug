	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>The third movement represents a departure from the struggles of
	the first two movements; but it does not cancel the need to resolve the
	conflicts presented so far. However, there are the first hints of the
	resolution to come in the fourth movement.</p>

	<p>Beethoven begins this movement with a variation on the Devotion theme,
	which will prove to be increasingly important as the symphony continues.
	In introducing the Devotion theme, Beethoven employs a technique known as
	<em>diminution</em> in which each melody note is replaced by several notes
	in smaller values. Beethoven unexpectedly fragments the theme in an
	interlude started by a clarinet and then imitated by the horn.</p>
