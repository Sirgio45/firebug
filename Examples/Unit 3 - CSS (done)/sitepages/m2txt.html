	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>After the drama of the first movement, audiences would expect a slow,
	relaxed second movement. Beethoven doesn't supply it. Instead he opens
	the curtain with a jarring scherzo. A schezo is a rapid movement in
	triple meter; in this treatment it would be more appropriate for a dance.</p>

	<p>The Development section is famous for its use of the timpani and for
	Beethoven's unusual decision to play <em>Ritmo di tre battute</em> (rhythm
	groups of three bars.) During the premier, this section was interrupted
	by applause as an enthusiastic audience demanded a repetition of the theme.
	The Recapitulation section does not imitate the Exposition section,
	instead it begins with a climatic orchestral statement, functioning almost
	as a retransition of the theme. The effect is electrifying.</p>

	<p>In dance movements, a trio is a contrasting middle section. The contrasts
	in the trio section could not be more pronounced. From a stormy scherzo in
	triple meter, Beethoven introduces a gentle major in duple meter: a preview
	of the resolution from the fourth movement.Following a trio, it was
	customary to repeat the main section. In this case that would mean
	repeating the scherzo. The Italian term, <em>da capo</em> means literally
	"to the head", in other words, "back to the beginning".</p>
