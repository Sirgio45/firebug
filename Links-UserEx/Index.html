    <h3 id="useful">Useful</h3>
    <p>If you were given the task to rake the lawn and put the leaves in a bag.
    You wouldn’t go out there and grab the lawn mower and go to town on the leaves. 
    You’re just making a bigger mess and flinging smaller pieces of leaves everywhere.
    The sane person might grab a useful tool in their garage and that tool would be a rake.
    You know from past experience that the rake is a useful resource to getting the job done. 
    Just like some web sites that people go back to time and time again. 
    Users are more likely to go back to a website if the site was found to be useful and help them with the task at hand. 
    Users are known to keep away from websites that have their content spread out all over the place. 
    You wouldn’t want to go to 5 different pages on a site just to find out that a rake is a better tool than a lawn mower to pick up the leaves?

    <h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
    <p>Majority of websites have tools to help the user navigate the page. 
    If you have different topics on the main page of the site. 
    You wouldn’t want the user to spend half of their time scrolling up and down trying to find the section they need. 
    Just like books, which have a table of contents and their page numbers. 
    Websites can have a navigation bar at the top of their main page and when clicked you get directed automatically to the clicked section. 
    A perfect example of this is the “Top of page” phase at the bottom of this page. 
    When click you are directed to top of the page. Go on… Click it.

    <h3 id="cross"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser#Background" target="_blank" Title="more info">Cross Browser Support</a></h3>
    <p>How many <a href="http://www.webdevelopersnotes.com/browsers-list"  target="_blank" Title="A list of Browsers">website browsers</a> are out there? 
    Now how many of those browsers are supported? 
    Can you run java or flash player on all of them? 
    Why am I asking a lot of questions? 
    The questions that were stated before are some of the few that web designers ask themselves each time when creating a new site.
    Browsers are different in many ways but it always comes down to one thing. 
    Will the site run like it was intended too on all major browsers and platforms?
    For example, most phones are either Android or Apple.  
    Android using Chrome for android browser and Apple iPhones using Safari for iOS. 
    With that being said, some things that will show up in the Desktop versions will not or have to be modify in a way to make them work in mobile phones. 
    Not everyone can afford a computer so you have to make sure that your website has a mobile version or is able to run on a mobile device.
    Another issue and the most annoying would be having to download another browser because your current one is not currently supported.
    Users half of the time will not download another browser and just go find their information somewhere else. 
    If you have a business online and that was the issue, you probably lost more than one customer. 
    Websites grow by popularity so if one person can’t access your site due to a browser compatibility issue. 
    Chances are you lost that user’s recommending you to their friends and so on.

    <h3 id="security">Security</h3>
    <p>Online shopping, we all do it and we all love it. 
    Why do we do it if the chances of getting our information stolen is higher than getting our information stolen while at a store in person?
    Well the is answer to that is because on how convenient online shopping has become. 
    Amazon for example, is one of the biggest online retail stores. 
    People trust Amazon or any other major online retailer because of the sense of security the user feels when shopping at the website.
    Most likely you see a padlock at the checkout menus or when entering your credit card information. 
    That padlock image is there to let the user know that the process is secure and encrypted.
    You might also see a message stating that the session is SSL Encrypted.
    Always check with the <a href="https://www.bbb.org/" Target="_blank" Title="Link to the Better Business Bureau">BBB</a> to see if any complaints have been reported about the company you're doing business with.

    <h3 id="colorScheme">Color Scheme</h3>
    <p>Not only do websites need to work, but they need to be easy on the user's eyes.
    Bright and light colors can strain eyes and give headaches.
    That is why it's very important to choose color combos that go well with each other.
    The colors that are given to the background of website can be the make it or break it moment for most users.
    It can make a web site look professional and organize. 
    Giving visitors the impression that the website is well structure.
    The colors have to go with the theme of the site being visited.
    Colors can be translated differently from monitor to monitor. 
    A low end monitor might be able to make a website with a background color yellow not look as bright and have no effect on eye strain.
    On the other hand, a higher end monitor visiting the same site might translate the yellow background as a brighter color. 
    Making it hard on the visitors to read the contents of the site and leaving the site early due to a headache.</p>
